description:
    "This is `fsverity`, a userspace utility for fs-verity.  fs-verity is "
    "a Linux kernel feature that does transparent on-demand "
    "integrity/authenticity verification of the contents of read-only "
    "files, using a Merkle tree (hash tree) hidden after the end of the "
    "file.  The mechanism is similar to dm-verity, but implemented at the "
    "file level rather than at the block device level.  The `fsverity` "
    "utility allows you to set up fs-verity protected files."
